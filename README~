Route Plot Plugin for OpenCPN
=======================================

The purpose of this plugin is to provide Search and Rescue Patterns (SAR), Great Circle, Limited Circle and Rhumb line plotting capability to OpenCPN

The aims are to:

1. Generate GPX files for a number of SAR patterns
2. Generate GPX files for a number of route plotting methods (I have yet to decide whether I should code a seperate plugin for this) 
3. Plot selected routes and SAR patterns directly in OpenCPN

Compiling
=========
You have to be able to compile OpenCPN itself - Get the info at http://opencpn.org/ocpn/developers_manual

* go to the plugin subdirectory in your OpenCPN source tree
* git clone https://github.com/SaltyPaws/route_pi.git

Build as normally:

* cd ..
* cd build
* cmake ../
* make
