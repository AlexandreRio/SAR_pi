SAR Plugin for OpenCPN
=======================================

The purpose of this plugin is to provide Search and Rescue Patterns (SAR) plotting capability to OpenCPN

The aims are to:

1. Generate GPX files for a number of SAR patterns
2. Plot selected SAR patterns directly in OpenCPN



Development Steps
=========
Work with OpenCPN API (Done)
Add Plugin Icon (Done)
Set-up GUI (Done)
Declare class to hold tracks
Set-up SAR calculating functions
Write tracks to GPX file
Set-up config screen

Compiling
=========
You have to be able to compile OpenCPN itself - Get the info at http://opencpn.org/ocpn/developers_manual

* go to the plugin subdirectory in your OpenCPN source tree
* git clone https://github.com/SaltyPaws/route_pi.git

Build as normally:

* cd ..
* cd build
* cmake ../
* make
* sudo make install

You will have to place the folder "bitmaps" into your build directory to see the images. I have yet to embed these into the sourcecode.
